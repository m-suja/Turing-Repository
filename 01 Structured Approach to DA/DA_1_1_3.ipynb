        "At Turing College, our focus is on cultivating outstanding Data Analytics skills for you and the dynamic job market. We maintain high learning standards to ensure you develop robust technical and soft skills, making your skillset highly attractive to current and future employers. Our curriculum emphasizes real-world readiness, often requiring independent research and problem-solving skills in projects. Remember, help is readily available – join open sessions, ask questions on Discord, or during standup.\n",

        "You are probably becoming more and more aware that you can find data pretty much everywhere. Any time you observe and evaluate something in the world, you are collecting and analyzing data. Your analysis helps you to find easier ways of doing things, to identify patterns, to save your time and to discover surprising new perspectives that can completely change the way you experience things. The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You will have to apply these six steps in your first practical project.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main goals of this first project. The first one is to get a more intuitive feeling about the mentioned steps of data analysis by trying to do a simple task in practice. The most important is that you would understand the aim and the process of data analysis. The aim is to solve a problem and the result is the data driven solution. So the process of data analysis is in between. Your project must have those parts and you should follow the steps of a structured approach to data analysis. The task is divided into these six steps to guide you, but read everything carefully before you start. All parts are connected to each other, so get the full picture first.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The second goal is to learn how the project reviews work in Turing College. You will get to schedule a project review, talk with an STL in a 1-1 call and get personalized feedback from them. Be sure to use this opportunity to ask the STL any questions that you are curious about!\n",

        "## 1. Ask\n",
        "Start with a problem you want to solve and define it.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can pick one area of your everyday life you would like to explore further. Think about how many times in the past week you made decisions about anything related to this area. Then, create a list and include details, such as the date, time, cost, quantity, size, etc. Try to focus on things that can be represented by a number or category.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Here are a few thought-starters:**\n",
        "- Number of cups of coffee/tea/water you drink daily\n",
        "- Number of steps you take daily\n",
        "- Range of emotions you have daily.\n",
        "\n",
        "After you have chosen a topic from your everyday life, you have to decide what problem you want to solve, like: to drink 2 liters of water per day, to drink less than 2 cups of coffee per day, to walk 10 000 steps everyday, to understand moments and reasons why you get upset/angry/confident/happy, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the analysts need to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, in order to determine these things, they ask effective questions, like:\n",
        "- What would initiate me to drink more water/less coffee?\n",
        "- Under which circumstances do I feel confident? What influences this feeling? Environment, time, emotional condition, etc.\n",
        "- What motivates me to be more physically active? What prevents?\n",
        "\n",
        "What questions help to determine if there was a solution for your problem? Write them down and go to the next step.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Prepare\n",
        "During this step, the analysts have to identify what data they need to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step. You can use the structure of this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2PRWxdaBq6lqWJNZEBeEKakl8QZ8luTlA3j3-WKOZc/copy\n",

        "- Duration for collecting new data: 1-2 days, max - 5 days. Do not waste a lot of time simply waiting for new data to collect and therefore stopping your learning because of it. It can be a very good idea to use already recorded data, like the amount of steps from your personal device - in such case you can have access to many days of data immediately.\n",

        "After the data collection, the data analysts have to store and protect the data. During this step, they also clean the data to make sure it is complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data can be aggregated and summarized. Let’s practice the mentioned techniques with your collected data.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Analyze\n",
        "Then, the analysts do what they do best: analyze! Let’s use aggregation and a graphical tool to analyze the data and reveal the findings and make some conclusions. You can use Google spreadsheets as a data analyses and a graphical tool. Do not worry about using overly complicated methods just yet (you will have a whole sprint for working with spreadsheets) - instead, try to use what you feel comfortable with already and if you like it, learn about a new technique or two that you feel would be relevant in this analysis.\n",

        "- If you're new to Google Spreadsheets or Excel, you can use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TENAbUa-R-w) as a reference. Just focus on the parts that you need for your spreadsheet work (don’t watch the full video) and remember not to make things too complicated.\n",

        "**Requirements for the presentation:**\n",
