# Project Description

For this project, I chose to analyse my screen time data.

**Hypothesis**

I spend a lot of time on my phone on social media apps. I feel moody and exhausted after scrolling through the endless content. I want to reduce my phone’s screen time so that I can focus more on other activities that keeps my mind and body active.

Data Source: [Screentime Data](https://github.com/m-suja/Turing-Repository/blob/main/01%20Structured%20Approach%20to%20DA/Screen%20Time%20Data-May.xlsx)

**Findings**

After further looking at my phone usage data:
- Certain, spike in screentime is caused by use of apps for learning language upon checking digital wellbeing report on spike days.
- Phone used during evening or before bed mostly 
- I initially thought I was spending a lot of time using social media but it turned out other apps were also causing higher screen time on some days.

**Recommendations**
Overall, I spent on average 3.3 hours on my phone which I would like to reduce by 2 hour.

- Replacing phone with books during the evenings or 30 mins before sleep.
- Setting timer for social media apps to reduce its use time by 20 mins.
- Involving further in outdoor activities daily for 40 min to prevent staying at home and scrolling the phone all day.
- Scheduling phone free time during the day for 30 mins


# Project Requirements
1. **Ask**
   
   Start with a problem you want to solve and define it.
   
   You can pick one area of your everyday life you would like to explore further. Think about how many times in the past week you made decisions about anything related to this area. Then, create a list and     include details, such as the date, time, cost, quantity, size, etc. Try to focus on things that can be represented by a number or category.
   
   Next, the analysts need to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, in order to determine these things, they ask effective questions, like:

2. **Prepare**
   
   During this step, the analysts have to identify what data they need to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step. You can use the structure of this template to collect your data as a guideline (of course, you can adjust the template to suit your problem or collect data straight to the Spreadsheets e.g.).
   
   If you do not want to spend time on data collection, you can use given data: hourly steps count for one week and hourly calories count for one week, or sleep data.
   The data collection should not take much of your time, look at the data requirements below:
   
   Duration for collecting new data: 1-2 days, max - 5 days. Do not waste a lot of time simply waiting for new data to collect and therefore stopping your learning because of it. It can be a very good idea to use already recorded data, like the amount of steps from your personal device - in such case you can have access to many days of data immediately.
   
   Number of observations: min - 10, max - 200.

4. **Process**
   
   After the data collection, the data analysts have to store and protect the data. During this step, they also clean the data to make sure it is complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data can be aggregated and summarized. Let’s practice the mentioned techniques with your collected data.


5. **Analyze**
   
   Then, the analysts do what they do best: analyze! Let’s use aggregation and a graphical tool to analyze the data and reveal the findings and make some conclusions. You can use Google spreadsheets as a data analyses and a graphical tool. Do not worry about using overly complicated methods just yet (you will have a whole sprint for working with spreadsheets) - instead, try to use what you feel comfortable with already and if you like it, learn about a new technique or two that you feel would be relevant in this analysis.


6. **Share**
   
   Almost the last step is here! Share your analysis and findings with stakeholders. In this case your stakeholder is Turing College STL. You have to create a report and present it to STL during a project review.

7. **Act**
   
   The last step in the data analysis process is to implement changes and take actions. What would you do in your daily life to solve your problem? Expect this question after your presentation.
