This is the first project for the Turing Data Analytics program.
For this project, I have chosen to analyse my screen time data so that I can figure out ways to minimize my screen time.
For the exploration I have used Google sheet, the link to which is: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bYSxcnONc7JSzAA5YNN-86b1kA1vrh_wCnochUkI-tU/edit?usp=sharing. NOTE: you might need to request for access!
