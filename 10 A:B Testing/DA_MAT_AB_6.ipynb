        "- Since there are three marketing campaigns and you have to select the best-performing one, you will have to conduct several tests, comparing campaigns against one another.. This kind of testing is known as pairwise comparisons and it suffers from the [multiple testing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) - if we run a lot of tests, there’s an increased chance of getting a type I error (false positive). It is therefore suggested to use the confidence level of 99% instead of the traditional 95% in your graded task.\n",
