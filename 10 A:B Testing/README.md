# Task
Analyze the A/B test and provide recommendations.

**Notes**

The dataset is aggregated by LocationID, PromotionID and week. You should aggregate by LocationID and PromotionID before conducting the statistical tests.
Since there are three marketing campaigns and you have to select the best-performing one, you will have to conduct several tests, comparing campaigns against one another. This kind of testing is known as pairwise comparisons and it suffers from the multiple testing problem - if we run a lot of tests, thereâ€™s an increased chance of getting a type I error (false positive). It is therefore suggested to use the confidence level of 99% instead of the traditional 95%.
