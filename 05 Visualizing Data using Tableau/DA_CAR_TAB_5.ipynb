        "- Some of the metrics and dimensions in charts are not clearly labeled\n",
        "- Some charts formatting is a bit confusing and could be worked on\n",
        "- The whole dashboard does not follow your company's branding because you used dark blue color which does not fit your company’s colors. Choose any other colors of the existing company and adjust the dashboard to suit them. (Or adjust the colors according to your preference)\n",
        "- Colleague also remembered that one of your exec team members is color blind and some charts are really confusing\n",

        "\n",
        "You should make a copy of the final dashboard from the Hands On task to clean it up, make it more interactive and advanced. Feel free to work with anything from formatting to adding completely new graphs and insights. Since this sprint requires a bit more creativity, this graded task is a bit more open and obscure than in other sprints. Though keep in mind that evaluation criteria is also more open to different creative approaches to solving it.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an alternative you can come up with a completely new dashboard if you wish. The only requirement is that you use the same [AdventureWorks company data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db) to construct your dashboard. However, due to Tableau Public limitations make sure to copy relevant data to Google Sheets and connect them as your data source.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once again, remember that we are giving you some freedom in your Graded Task, though we expect you follow guidelines you have learned in this sprint. Make sure you take into consideration the dashboard structure and ways to make sure the user understands the data you intend to be understood. For this you will have to come up with your own insights about data and make sure those insights tell a consistent and coherent story.\n",
