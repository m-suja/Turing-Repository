        "\n",
        "You got a follow up task from your product manager to give stats on how subscriptions churn looks like from a weekly retention standpoint. Your PM argues that to view retention numbers on a monthly basis takes too long and important insights from data might be missed out.\n",
        "\n",
        "You remember learning previously that cohorts analysis can be really helpful in such cases. You should provide weekly subscriptions data that shows how many subscribers started their subscription in a particular week and how many remain active in the following 6 weeks. Your end result should show weekly retention cohorts for each week of data available in the dataset and their retention from week 0 to week 6. Assume that you are doing this analysis on 2021-02-07.\n",
