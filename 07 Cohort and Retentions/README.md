# Project Description
Analyze subscription churn from a weekly retention perspective. The PM believes that viewing retention data on a monthly basis takes too long and may cause critical insights to be missed. To address this, calculate weekly retention rates for cohorts of users who started their subscriptions within a specific week and track how many remain active in the following 6 weeks.
