# Project Requirement
In this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cKgxrLLerfGbnGwDsGqrfe8LzYo_CGKgg6Ezbrga5-U/edit?usp=sharing) we have:
1. AdventureWorks.salesorderheader (with salesreasonID)
2. AdventureWorks.salesreason
3. AdventureWorks.employee (with contact data)
4. AdventureWorks.SalesTerritory

You've been tasked to populate the 'Overview' sheet with analytical insight:
1. Business would like to see the monthly sales trend.
2. They would also like to evaluate online vs non-online orders.

It would be nice for business to have an overview of:
1. The delivery performance trend (orderdate & Shipdate lag)
2. Top salesperson by sales, by volume.
3. Top countries.
4. Top sales reasons
5. Maybe you have an idea for business what could be interesting to look into from this data?

Technical part of the task should be followed by analytical part, so use structured approach to DA which you have learned in the first course. These are 6 steps you have to follow here:
1. Ask: what question you have to answer to get a business value of the analysis?
2. Prepare: what data you need to collect to answer your stated questions in the first step?
3. Process: store and clean your collected data. Check if it is correct.
4. Analyse: use analitical methods for analyses and reveal findings.
5. Share: present you insights.
6. Act: what changes have to be implemented according to your findings?"
