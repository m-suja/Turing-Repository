        "> Note:  we don't expect this project to be perfect - you will continue to improve your skills and there will be many projects for you to apply your newly gained skills in the future. For now just use what you have learned and try your best! And do not forget about Open Sessions!\n",

        "> Also, your project will be reviewed by a JTL rather than an STL. This is because the tasks in this sprint are particularly aligned with the expertise that JTLs possess, including their extensive experience in reviewing similar projects. JTLs are well-equipped to provide you with detailed feedback that will help you refine your skills further. While STLs typically handle sprints requiring deeper industry experience, JTLs are more suited to guide you through the challenges of this sprint, ensuring you gain the most from the review process.\n",

        "Imagine that you are a data analyst working for Spotify. Your team is responsible for content analysis, and in this quarter, you have decided to analyze Spotify's top hits and quantify what makes a hit song. Your team's product manager has many ideas and prepared a list of questions (requirements) that she wants you to get answers to. After reviewing the list of over 20 questions, you are not in a good mood - you'll have to work a couple of days to get all the answers. Luckily, a few days ago, an experienced data scientist working in your team queried the top 50 tracks for her machine learning project and agreed to share the data with you. This is a significant help - your SQL skills are not too sharp yet, and you don't yet know where to find all the relevant tables in your data warehouse. With this dataset, you are confident that you'll be able to answer all your PM's questions and maybe even look into some things that she didn't ask for.\n",

You will have to find the right balance between explaining the business side and the technical aspects of your work. You can assume that both of your colleagues have a strong understanding of and are very interested in the business aspect of your project, so be sure to clearly explain what new insights you've found while analyzing the dataset and which directions look the most promising for further research. However, you should also spend time explaining the technical aspects of your work, especially the more complex or unconventional choices.\n",
